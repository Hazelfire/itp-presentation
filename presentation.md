# Introduction
## We Love Software
Even for safety critical software like
- Rockets
- Cars
- Medical equipment

## Sometimes it doesn't work

Software bugs! Misunderstanding of specification etc

## How can we make sure software works?

Methods:
- Testing
- Code Review
- Formal Methods

# Formal Methods

Automation of Formal Methods:
 - Automatic Theorem Provers
 - Model Checkers

Interactive Formal Methods:
 - Interactive Theorem Provers

## Interactive Theorem Provers

Pros: Can Incorporate automatic theorem provers and strategies.

Cons: Boy are they hard to use!
